commands
cd - change directory
cd / takes you to the root directory
ls - lists contents of current directory
  modify commands with flags
  ls -t -most recent modification
  ls -l -long format
  ls -r -reverse ordering

use ^c to exit program
space is the default delimiter between strings
to escape use \
alternatively enclose in quotes

naming conventions
  no spaces in names - use - or _
  linux is case sensitive
  osx and windows are case insensitive
    use all lowercase, no spaces

navigating directories
  .. -up one directory
  . -current working directory
  ~ -home directory

paging through history
  history
    spits out entire history
    to page through use history | less
    to sort   history | sort |less
    history > filename.txt -outputs to file filename.txt
      if file exists, overwrites
      if not, creates
    history >> filename.txt -appends to file filename.txt
      if it does not exist, creates
